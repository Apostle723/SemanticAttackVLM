A watercolor of four majestic crimson parrots wearing elaborate, ornate golden crowns in the style of fantastical surrealism. They are gracefully perched on a towering, crystalline mountain in the ethereal glowing twilight on a misty spring day, reciting timeless ancient poetry against an endless, ever-shifting desert of enigmatic sands and mysterious pyramids under two intertwining, radiant rainbows.
